## ‚ú® How is Cogniforge special?
Unlike most online learning platforms, Cogniforge promotes projects over the traditional ‚Äòcourses‚Äô where students learn a lot of theory but never use it in practice. Instead, by having a project that connects to a real-world problem, students learn how to apply the concepts they are learning along the way to the problem. 

Additionally, in a traditional online course, students often don‚Äôt have immediate help; however, in a Cogniforge project, they will have access to an online community and mentors who can help guide them through the process.

## üèî Challenges and limitations
Every project comes with its challenges, and Cogniforge is no exception. For this to work, we will need to have mentors willing to help out students with questions and troubleshoot issues when a project first launches. However, as more people complete the projects, we can ask some of them who are active to become mentors for that project. 

Additionally, we must consider that we cannot cover every academic area and do a project for every topic, so the community preference on what projects should be launched next is very important.
